VLANS

MEMBERSHIP BY
PORT GROUP
Relatively easy to configure
Need reconfigure when end system moves
MAC ADDRESS
Mac address is hardwired into NIC
VLAN membership must be assigned initially
PROTOCOL INFORMATION
Flexible(IP address, transport or higher-layer protocol info)
Require switches to examine portions of MAC frame above MAC layer => performance impact

COMMUNICATING 
Switches must have a way of understanding VLAN membership(when station belong to which VLAN)
Configure information manually
Network management signaling protocol, so that switches can associate incoming frames with the appropriate VLAN
Frame tagging(IEEE 802.IQ)
Header is inserted into each frame on interswitch trunks to uniquely identify to which VLAN a particular MAC-layer frame belong
